# üìï --- 42 LIBFT PROJECT --- üìï

## This project aims to code a C library.

A library is a very handy tool which will follow you throughout all your coding career. You can litteraly view it as a book containing all sorts of usefull function you can acces whenever you want. 

Pretty handy don't you think ? By adding custom function is your library you are making sure you never have to overwrite them when you need it !
It is also a good idea to keep adding basic functions in it in order to make your own library as powerfull as possible.

You will be able to use your custom libft library in other projects so make sure to make it as strong as possible because it is a powerfull toolkit.

## üîó --- How to start with this project --- üîó

First of all be sure to know how to make a Makefile aswell as a .h file. This should be the case if you finished the piscine.
In case you are still struggling with those (I know I did), here's some documentation and tutorials which helped me :

-	https://makefiletutorial.com

If that was too easy already let's go to the project.

### 1. The libc functions

You will need to recode some existing functions from the libc library.
In order to validate the project you will have to use the same prototype as the original function prefixed by "ft_"

Looking up the protype aswell as the function description and returns values in the manual is a must. All of the libc function are listed and explained in the manual so make sure it becomes your best friend as it will be your best informations source.

In case you are feeling lazy I have written a small description of each functions in my files aswell as some comments to better understand why I did some "weird" things that wouldn't be obvious at first sight.

‚õîÔ∏è In order for you to get the most out of this project try to do it alone as much as prossible. ‚õîÔ∏è

What I mean by that is to look at other's code only when you are completely stuck. Learning by making your own mistakes is the best way to learn and to remember every concepts deeply.

### 2. Some more advanced functions

In this part the functions that you will come across are bit more challenging than the first ones (you might need multiple functions to make the main work). Not every functions of this part can be found in the manual so pay close attention to the subject PDF for this part. Once again I have some basic descriptions in my files if you need them. (But be sure to try it out self first !)

Note that in this part you're allowed to use some existing function to make yours work as write(), malloc() and free().

### 3. Bonus part

Of course you don't have to do the bonuses but I highly recommend you to do them as they are not that difficult, gives your project more XP and blackhole, and learn you some new concepts that will be VERY VERY usefull for the rest of 42's cursus. (The next project already asks you to know them)

To make it work you will need to declare a specific structure in your .h file. You got it, the bonus is all about structures and linked lists !
Here's some tutorials about how they works if it is new to you :

## üìå --- How to follow my project --- üìå

You can find my project in the libft/ forlder in my repository. That libft folder is made as you should send it for the project : all files at the root of your repository aswell as your .h file and Makefile. As asked in the project PDF, you should make a special rule for bonuses in your Makefile which will compile your mandatory functions aswell as the bonus ones.

Of course you project must follow the norm. Mine does it too, except for the comments. In case you look for some inspiration in my work, please don't forget to remove every comments.

Of course I will be providing some tester in order to check if your project works. Be aware that it is not because one tester give you 100% that you will surely get 100% once corrected. Tester are also made by students and it can happend that those tests don't check everything. That's why i'll give you a few.

Here's the link to the original testers :

-	https://github.com/Tripouille/libftTester
-	https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test
-	https://github.com/jtoty/Libftest
-	https://github.com/Ysoroko/FT_SPLIT_TESTER (Usefull ft_split tester)

‚õîÔ∏è Be sure to check how to use them aswell as how you must settup your repository to make it work ! ‚õîÔ∏è

Well that's everything you must know in order to validate your first project ! There is a lot of small easy functions to code so depending on your skill this might be faster to make. This project is estimated to take about 70 hours which I think is completely doable for everybody.

So good luck homie !

Feel free to send me a nessage if encountering any problems in my code ! üòÑ
